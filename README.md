# **CLIPS Programming for Cannibals and Missionaries Problem**
A Knowledge base for solving various queries derived from an AI-based Decision Tree. 

## Abstract
The C Language Integrated Production System, also known as CLIPS, is a public domain software tool mostly applied in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Systems. The concept of this project is to solve family tree-based problems with an acyclic structure of nodes. Given a set of rules and facts, the objective is to create a knowledge base for the following query:

A classic AI problem where the point is to get three cannibals and three missionaries across a stream with a boat that can only hold two people. If the cannibals outnumber 
the missionaries on either side of the stream, then the cannibals will eat the missionaries. 

## Origin
The first versions of CLIPS were developed starting in 1985 at NASA-Johnson Space Center (as an alternative to the existing system ART*Inference) until the mid-1990s when the development group's responsibilities ceased to focus on expert system technology. The original name of the project was "NASA's AI Language" (NAIL). CLIPS was probably the most widely used expert system tool as of 2005. CLIPS itself is written in C, extensions can be written in C, and CLIPS can be called from C. Its syntax resembles that of the programming language Lisp.
